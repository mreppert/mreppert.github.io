  <h1>Software</h1>
  <p>The group produces/contributes to several open-source software packages.  
  <h2 href="https://github.com/mreppert/g_amide">g_amide</h2><p>is a simulation package that interfaces with the popular molecular dynamics package gromacs (<a href="www.gromacs.org">www.gromacs.org</a>) to predict Amide I vibrational frequencies for backbone carbonyl groups in peptides and proteins. 
  <a href="https://github.com/mreppert/g_spec">g_spec</a> is a spectral simulation package that offers efficient numerical simulation of linear and 2D vibrational spectra. In conjunction with gromacs and g_amide, it offers a complete numerical library for converting protein structures into accurate Amide I vibrational spectra.
