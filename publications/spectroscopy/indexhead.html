<h2>Optical and Infrared Spectroscopy</h2>
    
    <img src="/cp47_hb.jpg" alt="Spectroscopy Overview" class="center">
    
    <p>Our group uses optical and infrared (IR) spectroscopy to probe both the atomistic and energetic structure of proteins and pigment/protein complexes (PPCs). Room-temperature absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy provide insight into the optical properties of photosynthetic systems under physiological conditions, while low-temperature hole burning (HB) spectroscopy and fluorescence line narrowing (FLN) spectroscopy offer detailed insight into the interactions between pigments and their protein environment. Isotope-edited IR absorption spectra are used to monitor both both global protein folds (e.g. helix vs. sheet) and local conformational changes (e.g. hydrogen bond formation).</p>
    
    <p>Although spectroscopic measurements provide critical insight into structure and dynamics, it can be extremely difficult to translate raw experimental data into a reliable, functionally-relevant interpretation. Our group specializes in developing quantitative tools for analyzing experimental data, through a combination of experimental standard development and <b><a href="/publications/dynamics" style="color:black">quantum/classical dynamical modeling</a></b>.
