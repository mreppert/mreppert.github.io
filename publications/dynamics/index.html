<h2>Quantum/Classical Dynamics</h2>

    <p>Although quantum mechanics in principle offers a complete description of both electronic and nuclear dynamics, rigorous quantum theory is too computationally intensive for even the smallest biologically-relevant systems. Our group develops mixed quantum-classical methods to describe the vibrational dynamics of peptides and proteins and the electronic dynamics of photosynthetic pigment/protein complexes (PPCs). In the simplest case, the entire protein or PPC can be described classically, using molecular dynamics (MD) for conformational dynamics and a frequency-dependent polarizability for local vibrational or electronic transitions. We have recently demonstrated that such simple classical models can accurately describe a large variety of absorption and coherent energy-transfer processes typically thought of as quantum-mechanical. More advanced models must incorporate real quantum features into the dynamics, particularly the "energy funnel" effect that enforces energy flow from high-frequency to low-frequency sites. </p>
    
    <p>A critical aspect of the group's research is that theoretical and computational models are developed and benchmarked directly against experimental <b><a href="/publications/spectroscopy" style="color:black">spectroscopic measurements</a></b>. This grounding in experimental reality in turn allows us to more confidentally apply our methods to unknown systems such as structurally-disordered peptides or spectrally-congested <b><a href="/publications/photosynthesis" style="color:black">photosynthetic PPCs</a></b>.
