<h1>Photosynthetic Light Harvesting</h1>
    
    <!--<p>Photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria accomplish an astounding array of molecular transformations in order to translate sunlight into biologically useful chemical energy&mdash;all using only abundant, environmentally-friendly starting materials. The growing need for sustainable energy has created increased interest in adapting this natural photosynthetic machinery to produce solar biofuels for industrial or commercial applications.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, there's a problem: Photosynthetic organisms are optimized in nature for competition, not efficiency. As a result, wild-type photosynthesis is in fact grossly <i>in</i>efficient at industrial-scale energy harvesting. A major problem is that organisms out-compete each other for solar energy: in a solar bioreactor, for example, cells near the top of the culture tend to capture far more light than they can process, while cells deeper in the culture are starved for energy.  </p>-->
    
    <p>Our group works to understand and control biological photosynthesis through site-specific mutagenesis in photosynthetic proteins. On the one hand, this work targets a quantitative understanding of <i>native</i> photosystem function at the molecular level, especially the optical properties and functional role of the many chlorophyll ligands bound by each photosynthetic protein. On the other hand, understanding native function opens the door to mutation-based optimization. Although native photosynthetic proteins are extremely effective at their native function&mdash;providing energy for the growth and survival of the organism&mdash;they are remarkably <i>inefficient</i>at the large-scale energy conversion needed for the biofuels industry. Our research aims to bridge this gap by targeted mutagenesis in wild-type proteins.</p>
