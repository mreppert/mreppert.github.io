    <p>Our group works to understand and control biological photosynthesis through site-specific mutagenesis in photosynthetic proteins. On the one hand, this work targets a quantitative understanding of <i>native</i> photosystem function at the molecular level, especially the optical properties and functional role of the many chlorophyll ligands bound by each photosynthetic protein. On the other hand, understanding native function opens the door to mutation-based optimization. Although native photosynthetic proteins are extremely effective at their native function&mdash;providing energy for the growth and survival of the organism&mdash;they are remarkably <i>inefficient</i> at the large-scale energy conversion needed for biofuel production. Our research aims to bridge this gap <i>via</i> targeted mutagenesis in wild-type proteins.</p>
    
    <p>To acheive these goals, targeted mutation studies are complemented by high-resolution <b><a href="/publications/spectroscopy/" style="color:black">spectroscopy</a></b> and mixed <b><a href="/publications/dynamics" style="color:black">quantum/classical simulation and theory</a></b>.
