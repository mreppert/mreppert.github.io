  <p><a href="https://nanohub.org/tools/molspec" style="color:blue"><b>Molecular Spectroscopy</b></a> is a graduate course at Purdue (CHM 67600) that explores the physical and chemical origins of molecular optical spectroscopies such as absorption, emission, pump-probe, hole burning, and two-dimensional spectroscopy. Lectures are paired with interactive molecular dynamics simulations and step-by-step guided programming assignments (Python language) in which students learn about Maxwell's and Newton's equations, Fourier transforms, linear and nonlinear response, line broadening mechanisms, and the principles of quantum mechanics. </p><br>

  <p><a href="https://nanohub.org/tools/chm37301" style="color:blue"><b>CHM 37301</b></a>  is the lab component of the Purdue Chemistry Department's two-semester undergraduate Physical Chemistry course. The course combines in-lab experiments with online assignments that guide students through the analysis of their experimental data, and introduce basic Python programming skills along the way.
