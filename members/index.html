  <h2>Mike Reppert</h2>
  <h3>Assistant Professor</h3>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/mike_reppert.jpg" alt="Mike Reppert" class="profile" align="left">
  <p>A Kansas native, Mike completed his BS at Kansas State University in 2009 in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Math. It was also at Kansas State (during four years of undergrad research) where he became fascinated by the molecular mechanisms of photosynthesis. After a year of Fulbright research at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, he went on to work in 2D IR spectroscopy and peptide structural analysis with Andrei Tokmakoff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago. After obtaining his PhD in 2016, he worked as a Banting Scholar with Professor Paul Brumer at the Chemical Physics Theory group of the University of Toronto, investigating the importance&mdash;or nonimportance&mdash;of quantum effects in biological light harvesting. In summer 2019, he moved to Purdue to begin his own research group in Physical Chemistry, working to develop both experimental and computational tools to quantitatively understand structure/spectrum relationships in biomacromolecules, particularly photosynthetic proteins.</p>

  <h2>Amit Srivastava</h2>
  <h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/amit_srivastava.jpg" alt="Amit Srivastava" class="profile" align="left">
  <p>Amit completed his B.Sc. at CSJM University (India) and moved to BHU (India) to obtain his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in plant biotechnology. In his Ph.D. he worked on understanding the molecular mechanism of stress adaptation in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria where he got the DAAD scholarship to conduct his research in Germany.  After finishing his Ph.D. he moved to the Czech Republic to continue his study on cyanobacterial genetics as a postdoctoral researcher. His studies were supported by international grant agencies such as DFG (Germany), DST (India) and GACR (CR). He is currently interested to determine the optical properties and functional roles of specific chlorophyll ligands in the Photosystem II core complex and to explore the potential for increasing PSII efficiency via targeted mutagenesis. When not in lab, he likes to spend time with his wife and does face-time with his family. His other free time leisure are travelling, cooking and movies. </p>

  <h2>Chientzu Lin</h2>
  <h3>Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/chientzu_lin.jpg" alt="Chientzu Lin" class="profile" align="left">
  <p>Chientzu is an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Chemistry ACS. She is from Taiwan and grew up in Shanghai, China. She is currently working on running simulations involving WSCP and other chlorophyll proteins. Favorite Food: French Fries</p>

  <h2>Jacob Hnatusko Wat</h2>
  <h3>Graduate Student</h3>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/jacob_wat.jpg" alt="Jacob Wat" class="profile" align="left">
  <p>Jacob completed his degree in chemistry with a minor in studio art at DePaul University. At DePaul Jacob was a part of Dr. Graham Griffin's research group and did excited state energy calculations and coding to study organic semiconductors. In his free time he enjoys photography, creating art and gardening. His research interests are in photo and phytochemistry. Favorite plant: Oleander.</p>

  <h2>Safa Ahad</h2>
  <h3>Graduate Student</h3>
  <p>Safa graduated in 2019 with a B.S. degree in chemistry from West Virginia University. At WVU, Safa was part of Dr. Lisa Holland's research group working on steroid separations using UV-vis capillary electrophoresis. Her hobbies include working out, painting and cuddling her cat.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size:200%;">Alex Flohr</h3>
  <h3>Undergraduate Student</h3>
  <p style="font-size:130%;">A serial hobbyist and athlete, Alex Flohr likes to explore most sports, books, and problems he encounters. In his free time, he can be found working on motorcycles or fishing the great lakes. Currently a student at Purdue University, Alex enjoys the challenges of scientific research as well as hands on development of assistive technology with Purdue EPICS. Heâ€™s pretty sure that Star Trek contributed to at least 80% of his love of science. In the future, Alex would like to work in the energy sector, applying his knowledge of chemistry to develop and research methods of improving renewable energy.</p>
