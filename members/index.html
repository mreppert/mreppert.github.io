  <a href="/cv/CV.pdf">Curriculum Vita</a>
  <p style="font-size:130%;">A Kansas native, Mike completed his BS at Kansas State University in 2009 with majors in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Mathematics. At Kansas State, he worked for four years in undergraduate research with Professor Ryszard Jankowiak, where he first became fascinated by the molecular structure and function of photosynthetic proteins. He next completed a year of research as a Fulbright scholar at the Polish Academy of Sciences (Institute of Physics) in Warsaw, Poland where he studied low-temperature line-narrowing spectroscopies including both difference fluorescence line narrowing and single-molecule spectroscopy. In 2016, Mike obtained his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, having conducted research in 2D IR spectroscopy (theory and experiment) under Professor Andrei Tokmakoff at both MIT and the University of Chicago. Following a three-month visiting postdoctoral position with Matthias Kr&uuml;ger at the University of Stuttgart, Mike has worked with Professor Paul Brumer at the Chemical Physics Theory group of the University of Toronto, investigating the importance -- or nonimportance -- of quantum effects in biological light harvesting. </p>
