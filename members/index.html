  <p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Mike Reppert</b></span><br>
  Assistant Professor<br>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/mike_reppert.jpg" alt="Mike Reppert" class="profile" align="left"></p>
  <p class=bio>A Kansas native, Mike completed his BS at Kansas State University in 2009 in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Math. It was also at Kansas State (during four years of undergrad research) where he became fascinated by the molecular mechanisms of photosynthesis. After a year of Fulbright research at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, he went on to work in 2D IR spectroscopy and peptide structural analysis with Andrei Tokmakoff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago. After obtaining his PhD in 2016, he worked as a Banting Scholar with Professor Paul Brumer at the Chemical Physics Theory group of the University of Toronto, investigating quantum effects in biological light harvesting. In summer 2019, he moved to Purdue to begin his own research group in Physical Chemistry, working to develop both experimental and computational tools to quantitatively understand structure/spectrum relationships in biomacromolecules, particularly photosynthetic proteins. <br><br><a href="/cv/CV.pdf">Curriculum Vita</a></p>
  
  <p><span style="font-size:125%;"><b>Amala Phadkule</b></span><br>
  Graduate Student<br>
  <img src="/members/photos/cropped/amala_phadkule.jpg" alt="Amala Phadkule" class="profile" align="left"></p>
  <p class=bio>Amala completed B.Sc. Chemistry and M.Sc. Organic Chemistry from the University of Pune (India). In December 2020, she graduated from the University of Alabama with MS Chemistry degree. Amala is interested in molecular biology and spectroscopy. After work, you can find Amala cooking, baking or painting. Favorite cake: Tres leches.</p><br>

  <p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Brandon Parker</b></span><br>
  	Graduate Student<br>
	<img src="/members/photos/cropped/brandon_parker.jpg" alt="Brandon Parker" class="profile" align="left"></p>
	<p class=bio>Born and raised in Washington State. Brandon completed his BS at Western Washington University in Chemistry. During his Junior and Senior year, Brandon did molecular dynamics research with molecular solar thermal fuels underneath Dr. Tim Kowalczyk. Brandon's research interests are in quantum dynamics in open quantum systems. During his off time, Brandon enjoys spending time with his birds, strumming any instrument with strings, modifying/repairing electronics,  and exercising.</p><br>

	<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Dorothea Illner</b></span><br>
  	Graduate Student<br>
	<img src="/members/photos/cropped/dorothea_illner.png" alt="Dorothea Illner" class="profile" align="left"></p>
	<p class=bio>Dorothea earned her B.Sc. in Chemistry from the Phillipps-University Marburg in Germany and her M.Sc. in Chemistry from the Florida Institute of Technology. Her research intersects biochemistry and computational chemistry, while she has a personal interest for astrosciences. She honors her German roots by taking long hikes and baking homemade bread. Inspired by Schrödinger´s famous cat, she adopted a kitten-one who is very much alive, extremely observable, and strongly against boxes of any kind. </p><br>

	<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Nico de Cordoba</b></span><br>
  	Graduate Student<br>
	<img src="/members/photos/cropped/nico_decordoba.jpeg" alt="Nico De Cordoba" class="profile" align="left"></p>
	<p class=bio>Nicolas Alberto carlos Jose de Cordoba (Nico) is a biochem graduate student. He graduated from springhill college with a degree in molecular and cellular biology then worked at a microbrewery despite being allergic to beer. His interest in science was born from a love of Pokémon wanting to be a Pokémon professor. He loves poker, sunlight, and Pokémon.</p><br>

	<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Devin Hiatt</b></span><br>
  	Graduate Student<br>
  	<img src="/members/photos/devin_hiatt.png" alt="Devin Hiatt" class="profile" align="left"></p>
  	<p class=bio>Devin completed his BS at Indiana State University in 2024 in Chemistry. During his time at ISU, Devin did computational chemistry work under Dr. Eric Glendening. Devin is interested in spectroscopy and computational chemistry. In his free time, Devin enjoys astronomy, watching and playing sports, and playing guitar. </p> <br>

	
	<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Angelina Fisher</b></span><br>
  	Undergraduate Student<br>
	<img src="/members/photos/cropped/angelina_fisher.jpg" alt="Angelina Fisher" class="profile" align="left"></p>
	<p class=bio>Angelina is an undergraduate getting her B.S. in Biochemistry (Chemistry) and a minor in classical studies. She is interested in pharmacology, biochemistry, and anything involving chemistry. In her free time she enjoys scrapbooking, reading, and watching documentaries and movies.</p><br>
	
<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Laika and Oppy</b></span><br>
  Group Mascot<br>
	<img src="/members/photos/cropped/laika_and_oppy.jpg" alt="Laika and Oppy" class="profile" align="left"></p>
<p class=bio>This is Laika (black and gray) and Oppy (white and brown). Laika is a Norwegian Elkhound named for the first dog in space, which is fitting since the Elkhound is one of the oldest dog breeds in the world. Laika does not hunt moose like her ancestors, instead being a master of getting food from her human mom. Oppy was the nickname given to the Opportunity rover by NASA scientists, and our Oppy is certainly an opportunistic hunter, but less for food or animals and more for the unsuspecting face to lick!</p><br>

<p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Biscuit</b></span><br>
  Group Mascot<br>
<img src="/members/photos/cropped/biscuit.jpg" alt="Nico De Cordoba" class="profile" align="left"></p>
<p class=bio>This is Biscuit. </p><br>

 <p><span style="font-size:125%;"><b>Jacob Hnatusko Wat</b></span></p><br>
  Graduate Student<br>
<!--   <p class=bio>Jacob completed his degree in chemistry with a minor in studio art at DePaul University. At DePaul Jacob was a part of Dr. Graham Griffin's research group and did excited state energy calculations and coding to study organic semiconductors. In his free time he enjoys photography, creating art and gardening. His research interests are in photo and phytochemistry. Favorite plant: Oleander.</p><br> -->

  <p><span style="font-size:125%; "><b>Sarah Alvarez</b></span></p><br>
  Undergraduate Researcher<br>
<!--   <p class=bio>Sarah is an undergrad pursuing a degree in Biochemistry with minors in plant science and biology. She is currently working on studying the spectroscopic properties of photosynthetic proteins in cyanobacteria. Outside of research you will find her hanging out with her pets, plants, and friends, probably drinking tea. She also enjoys cooking/baking, painting (not well), and going for hikes or trips to the beach.
